<h2>Writing first program</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In this topic, you will learn how to develop your first Python programs. Even though these programs are quite simple, they are still syntactically correct and show that programming in Python is a treat.</p>

<p>As you can see, this program consists of a single line. It prints the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6842" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes. | It is a common and useful data type, often used to represent textual information.

<p><strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7139" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The 'print' function in Python is a built-in function used to output data to the standard output device (like a screen). | It can take various types of arguments, such as strings, integers, lists, etc. By default, the output is separated by spaces and ends with a newline. However, you can customize the separator and end character using the 'sep' and 'end' keyword arguments, respectively. Additionally, the 'print' function can handle multiple arguments, printing them out sequentially with the specified separator and end character.">print</a></strong> is the name of a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5900" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. | It is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block. Functions can take zero or more arguments, and they can return one or more values.

Functions can be used to encapsulate complex logic, making it easier to test and debug.">function</a>.

However, Python's dynamic typing and use of names as references to objects, rather than directly storing values, make its naming system particularly important to understand.">name</a> of a function is followed by parentheses, it means the function was <strong>called</strong> to get the result.</p>
<p>Let's go further: <code class="language-python">"Hello, World!"</code> is a Python string. All strings are surrounded by <em>single</em> or <em>double</em> quotes, so <code class="language-python">'Hello, World!'</code> is also a valid string. You may replace this string with another one, and the program will print the new string. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print('Python 3.x')</code></pre>
<p>As you might guess, this program will print the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Python 3.x</code></pre>

<p>Imagine that the string you want to print already contains <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a quotation mark is used to define a string, which is a sequence of characters. | Strings can be surrounded by either single or double quotation marks, and there is no difference between the two in terms of functionality.

If you would like to include them into a string, enclose this string in quotes of <strong>another</strong> type, e.g.:</p>

<p>The part of the string with <code class="language-python">I'm</code> is printed <strong>correctly</strong> because you used <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5814" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a double quote is used to denote a string literal, which is a sequence of characters. | It is one of the two types of quotes that can be used to create strings, the other being single quotes. Double quotes are often used when the string itself contains a single quote, to avoid the need for escaping. However, the choice between single and double quotes is largely a matter of personal preference and convention, as both are functionally equivalent in Python.">double quotes</a> <code class="language-python">"..."</code> to enclose the whole string:</p>

<p>This statement does not work because of extra spaces before <code class="language-python">print</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Calling a function by the wrong name</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">pint("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
<p>This line contains <code class="language-python">pint</code> instead of <code class="language-python">print</code>. Make sure to refer to every function by its proper name.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Writing names in the wrong case</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">PRINT("All caps")</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-python">Print</code>, <code class="language-python">print</code> and <code class="language-python">PRINT</code> are not the same. Names are case-sensitive in Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing one or both quotes for a string</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("Python)</code></pre>
<p>This statement does not work because of missing closing quotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Missing one or more parentheses</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-python">print("I have no end"</code></pre>
<p>Be careful with parentheses, especially when calling a function.</p>
